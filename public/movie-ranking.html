<h1>The Best Movies According To Krishna</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1.Leo</h3>
<p>It's a pure action entertainer with a perfect first half, followed by a decent second half. Except for the car chase sequence and the final action sequence, it was lit. I'm not saying those were bad, but they pushed the limits of physics and logic to the extreme. Other than some minor issues in the screenplay, I thought it was a pretty good movie. Personally, I loved watching the movie in a houseful theater. I don't know if it will be the same when it comes out on digital platforms, so go watch it in theaters. Not having high expectations will also help you enjoy the movie better. Can't wait to see the next installments in the LCU</p>
<h3>2.Manjumel Boys</h3>
<p>"Manjummel Boys" takes audiences on an exhilarating journey as it explores the resilience of the human spirit when faced with adversity. Anchored by a gripping storyline centered around a man's harrowing experience of falling into a cave, the film expertly blends suspense, drama, and moments of sheer determination. Through breathtaking cinematography and compelling performances, viewers are drawn into the protagonist's struggle for survival and the unwavering support of his friends. "Manjummel Boys" is a riveting tale of courage, friendship, and the triumph of the human will, leaving audiences on the edge of their seats until the very end.</p>
<h3>3.Master</h3>
<p>Perfect characteristation for both VIJAY & VJS. 2nd half is little bit lagging without no story move.Except that VJ mannerism makes u crazy also VJS Terrorism ll haunt u.Worth Watching not like other Thalapathy Movies. Vijay just given up his image & allowed everyone to mock him Its a sign of selfless actor.Climax & interval block was terrific.Dont listen to negative reviews.Its a pure commercial entertainment & decent watchable</p>
